      'At Netspend, I worked on a platform/framework team responsible for enabling feature teams to write better code. A few of my accomplishments from working there involve migrating our legacy build system (rush and pnpm) to a much faster monorepo bazel build system, building our React based UI framework, writing advanced docs and training materials, and working on multiple bespoke packages for things like gateways, routing, microfrontends, animations, and more. It was an incredibly fun and fulfilling experience, and I would love to work on another platform team in the future.',

It was initially released between 2016-2017; getting over 200,000 total downloads, featured on Product Hunt, and consistently ranked in the top 10 developers tools on the Mac App Store. Unfortunately, I was unable to continue supporting the application for free, as I got busy with other things in my career. If I could go back and re-do it, I would have attempted to use a patreon-like funding model, since there was a strong cult-like following for my incredibly minimal code editor.",

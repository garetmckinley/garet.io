{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>Music is, of course, a slightly touchy and very subjective topic. Especially when discussing what to listen to while doing various tasks. Though for me personally, I have clear-cut answers to what works best for me while programming.</p>\n<p>To start with, I typically avoid anything containing vocals. I like massive ambient soundscapes with intricate details. It seems to stimulate the logic-processing parts of my brain (whether or not that's true, I have no idea). But it definitely keeps me productive.</p>\n<p>Tracks like this one by Shulman are among my favorites.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/track/7om71g8UGLTOqwD2r7PADZ?si=bfssiRJwSOCLifhK-lFayA\"><iframe src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/7om71g8UGLTOqwD2r7PADZ\" width=\"100%\" height=\"400\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allow=\"encrypted-media\"></iframe></a></p>\n<p>I also prefer listening to longer tracks or full album mixes instead of single tracks. This is because when tracks are constantly changing, I feel like my mood and productivity is also changing. It takes a little bit to get situated into a track and find your rhythm within it, but when tracks are short and rapidly changing, I feel my productivity suffering.</p>\n<p>When I have a project or task that I need to pump out quickly, I typically put on the Wobble Factor mix by Tipper.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/track/3TF6GBh0AKdBeHS1dezWMC\"><iframe src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/3TF6GBh0AKdBeHS1dezWMC\" width=\"100%\" height=\"400\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allow=\"encrypted-media\"></iframe></a></p>\n<p>The high energy and constant basslines keep me in my groove, and it's a full hour seamless mix! I don't personally recommend mixes this high-energy when problem-solving or debugging a complex issue though. I find that the ambient spaces I mentioned above work much better for that. Songs with heavy basslines or rapid kick rhythms can actually become quite annoying when trying to carefully analyze error messages.</p>\n<p>Honestly though, for most programming tasks, I typically listen to artists like Shulman or Bluetech</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/artist/0nLTVC5FExtXgF3RoLh0TH?si=SIPTIBZHTaiODE_WNqB-BA\"><iframe src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/artist/0nLTVC5FExtXgF3RoLh0TH\" width=\"100%\" height=\"400\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allow=\"encrypted-media\"></iframe></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/artist/5yUtOYdnxxWdcIoZM1dx68?si=mwtA1AX2SeKRk-PzO4zQsA\"><iframe src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/artist/5yUtOYdnxxWdcIoZM1dx68\" width=\"100%\" height=\"400\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allow=\"encrypted-media\"></iframe></a></p>\n<p>Ott is another one of my favorites that is a bit more dub than ambient</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/artist/1F102kNzMqsmOpF7AfFmm5?si=pknbJ2DKTcGTQ1847z8F4g\"><iframe src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/artist/1F102kNzMqsmOpF7AfFmm5\" width=\"100%\" height=\"400\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allow=\"encrypted-media\"></iframe></a></p>\n<p>And finally, my last artist recommendation is Sephira. He creates incredible story-telling atmospheres that bring chills to my skin every time he comes on my Spotify playlists.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/artist/6U9J4NxtfWCfH7Iu2lMrNr?si=j38_k55DSMy67OdWBvZp7A\"><iframe src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/artist/6U9J4NxtfWCfH7Iu2lMrNr\" width=\"100%\" height=\"400\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allow=\"encrypted-media\"></iframe></a></p>\n<p>If you like the style of music I've recommended in this post, I created a 15-hour playlist encapsulating this deep psydub style of music. If you're on Spotify, give it a try next time you sit down to write some code.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/user/garetmckinley/playlist/2SmGA6PDALbMzfBwseeDNx?si=CDGId95KQHis8uYipbXLzQ\"><iframe src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/user/garetmckinley/playlist/2SmGA6PDALbMzfBwseeDNx\" width=\"100%\" height=\"400\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allow=\"encrypted-media\"></iframe></a></p>\n<p>Oh and one more thing! These Spotify playlists are embedded in my blog posts via my new plugin <a href=\"https://github.com/garetmckinley/gatsby-remark-embed-spotify\">gatsby-remark-embed-spotify</a>. It allows you to paste valid Spotify share link anywhere in your markdown posts and automatically transforms them into embeds!</p>","timeToRead":3,"frontmatter":{"title":"What do I listen to while programming?","date":"September 12th, 2018"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/music-for-programming/"}}
